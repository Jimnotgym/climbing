<h2>Description</h2>

<p>OS grid reference OS Explorer 241 'Shrewsbury' Grid ref: 525237</p>

<p>Grinshill is a series of natural sandstone outcrops and disused quarries a few miles north of Shrewsbury. The hill itself is a stark break to the relatively flat lands of North Shropshire, and this, along with it proximity to the MOD helicopter training school at RAF Shawbury means that the summit bears a bright red beacon. <br><br>Stone from Grinshill has been used for centuries to build both the nearby village bearing its name, and some of the great structures of Shrewsbury, such as its 'English' and 'Welsh' bridges <br><br>The rock itself varies from soft crumbly red sandstone to a grey cement like variety that was more valued for building. The whole area of the hill is covered with small outcrops and the remaiing smooth faces of the long abandoned quarry. Grinshill is renowned as a bouldering venue, and a place for highballs and topropes. Many ascents have been lead or solo'd, but any climber should think carefully about the limited protection offered by sandstone and note that the relatively high subjective grades point towards this danger. There is lots to interest the beginner, but also plenty to keep experienced climbers interested. One strong note of caution is that the belays should be inspected before you climb. Some areas offer trees, but they are often far back, and the prudent climber would find much use for a second rope. At the top rocks especially the belay anchors are a trig point and view point, which is some 20-30 metres from the cliff edge! <br><br>Grinshill is a great place for evening bouldering, or saving a wasted day, but not for epic adventures. The definitive guidebook was Doug Kerr's excellent 'West Midlands Rock', out of print and absurdley expensive second-hand. Stuart Cathcart added the self described 'Shropshire Bouldering', which is probably even more rare. 'Boulder Britain' by Nial Grimes shows a small number of routes and has some nice maps</p>

<h2>Access</h2>
<p>Park at Corbett Wood car park only. Please don't park in any of the villages or access is at risk. Access is possible by train to Yorton, a short distance away, or by bus to Clive from Shrewsbury. Organised groups should not use this crag, and groups of more than 6 friends should either split up or frankly find a better crag for a team. Paths lead in every direction. For access to the Top rocks, Middle rocks, the Sugarlump etc. you should walk back towards the entrance road. A private road appears on the left where you can walk along the tops of some of the quarries to a clearing by the school at OS:517240. Directions from here are in each individual area descriptions. A path runs at the southern end of the car park heads eastwards to Ass creek and the White Tower. The woods are full of short-cuts which you can enjoy discovering at your leisure. Please check back soon as we have some amazing maps coming

  <h2>The Sugarlump</h2>
  <img  src="sugarlump.jpg">
    <p>From the clearing by the school, find the path southwards which leads into the trees and down the stone steps. On your right is a kind of stone seat under a roof which forms the pancake area. A green wall gives way to a gully before the marked promontary of the Sugarlump itself. For climbs on the Sugarlump itself a short piece of rope is required to extend the tree belays to the edge, otherwise you will be making the rope grooves worse! For Tate and Lyle a rope is still usefull, but a long sling would suffice. Climbs are described left-to-right. A topo will be online soon</p>

  <h2>Top Rocks-Broken Buttress</h2>
  <img  src="">
    <p>The summit of Grinshill is is reached from the school clearing by following the obvious footpath heading south-east. On your right as you climb are some telegraph poles which help mark the middle rocks which are now below you. After a short but arduous climb through the tunnel of trees you break out into the open by the beacon. Sit and admire the view for a while, maybe tut at the your rascals who scratched their names in the rock (pretending of course that you never did that sort of thing). There are two scallop shapped cliffs split down the middle by a dirty gully. The westtern side is known as 'Broken Buttress', the east as 'Main Buttress'. A path to the east of main buttress is more open than the gully and leads around the base of both parts. There is nowhere to set a belay on either cliff edges, and the normal solution is to run a long rope from the trig point or viewing point to the edge. Others choose to solo. Once at the base of the crag you can orientate yourself by moving east from the gulley whereupon you will find a bay with 'cockles' at its centre and the interesting pillar at the right. These days it is worth having something to snip the odd briar and a bin-bag to pick up some accumulated rubish from the summit, that way you can wear a smug grin as you declare yourself a good person. Despite the difficulties there are some fun easy climbs here for a top-roping beginner.</p>
