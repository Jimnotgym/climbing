"description":"The summit of Grinshill is is reached from the school clearing by following the obvious footpath heading south-east. On your right as you climb are some telegraph poles which help mark the middle rocks which are now below you. After a short but arduous climb through the tunnel of trees you break out into the open by the beacon. Sit and admire the view for a while, maybe tut at the your rascals who scratched their names in the rock (pretending of course that you never did that sort of thing). There are two scallop shapped cliffs split down the middle by a dirty gully. The westtern side is known as 'Broken Buttress', the east as 'Main Buttress'. A path to the east of main buttress is more open than the gully and leads around the base of both parts. There is nowhere to set a belay on either cliff edges, and the normal solution is to run a long rope from the trig point or viewing point to the edge. Others choose to solo. Once at the base of the crag you can orientate yourself by moving east from the gulley whereupon you will find a bay with 'cockles' at its centre and the interesting pillar at the right. These days it is worth having something to snip the odd briar and a bin-bag to pick up some accumulated rubish from the summit, that way you can wear a smug grin as you declare yourself a good person. Despite the difficulties there are some fun easy climbs here for a top-roping beginner."}
