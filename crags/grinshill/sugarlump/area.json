"description":"From the clearing by the school, find the path southwards which leads into the trees and down the stone steps. On your right is a kind of stone seat under a roof which forms the pancake area. A green wall gives way to a gully before the marked promontary of the Sugarlump itself. For climbs on the Sugarlump itself a short piece of rope is required to extend the tree belays to the edge, otherwise you will be making the rope grooves worse! For Tate and Lyle a rope is still usefull, but a long sling would suffice. Climbs are described left-to-right. A topo will be online soon"}
